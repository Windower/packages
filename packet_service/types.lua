-- NPC Update
-- There are two different types of these packets. One is for regular NPCs, the other occurs for certain NPCs (often nameless) and differs greatly in structure.

-- The second one seems to have an int counter at 0x38 that increases by varying amounts every time byte 0x1F changes.
-- Currently I don't know how to algorithmically distinguish when the packets are different.
